TODOs:
  -Use a XML metafile for the transfer functions
  -Pass the type of vertex attributes to each mesh of the TinyGL lib. Or Manually create the buffers and attach them to the mesh later.
  -Use a 2D transfer function + vertex-branch map or a preaaplied alpha dataset?
FIXMEs:
  -Name replication of the transfer functions.
  -For some reason, functions corresponding to ushort datatypes do not get uploaded
