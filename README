TODOs:
  -Pass the type of vertex attributes to each mesh of the TinyGL lib. Or Manually create the buffers and attach them to the mesh later;
  -Make the use of a transfer function optional (pass a uniform parameter to the shader). This can be used to render a dataset when no TF is selected;
  -Make a topological visualizer. Find the coordinates of the contour tree vertices and plot them;
  -Make it possible to use a global color function with local opacity functions (change the shaders basically);

FIXMEs:
  -Performance issues when marking branches for removal (TopAnalyzer).
    -Perhaps put all the branches in an array, ordered by level and iterate from the end to the beginning removing any branches that should be removed.
    -Other idea is to queue all the leaves, iterate over them and remove any that is below the threshold. Then we insert any new leaves created in the queue.


QUESTIONS:
  -Use a 2D transfer function + vertex-branch map or a preaplied alpha dataset?
