/**
 * class Mesh
 * This class is an abstraction of an mesh. It holds only the basic information
 * needed to draw one. The draw function is passed as a callback since this makes
 * the control easier. Ideally any simple mesh should inherit from this one and
 * define its own draw function.
 * The class also holds a series of buffers that store the information about it.
 * They may be buffers of any kind (vertex, color, normals, texture coordinates,
 * temparature, density, generation, cost, etc). All buffers are deleted and the
 * vector holding them is purged when the destructor is called.
 * The mesh also hold a material color, such attribute defines the material of the
 * mesh by holding an RGBA color.
